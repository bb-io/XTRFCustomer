## Introduction

<!-- begin docs -->

The Client Portal allows your clients to submit a job or quote request 24/7, rather than waiting for your office hours. After all, when it comes to quoting, speed is the name of the game. You can choose to respond with an automated quote, or keep the quoting process manual.

## Before setting up

Before you can connect you need to make sure that:

- You have a XTRF account
- You have a XTRF client, based on which you can successfully log in to the XTRF Customer portal
- You have `Username` and `Password` for the XTRF client
- You have the `Host` for the XTRF Customer portal. E.g. `organization.xtrf.eu`, this is the domain you use to log in to the XTRF Customer portal.

Typically URL for the XTRF Customer portal is `https://[your-xtrf-host.com]/customers`. Note that for XTRF Customer portal you are using the same host as for the common XTRF system, the only difference is the path.

## Setting up the XTRF client for the XTRF Customer portal

1. Create a new client in XTRF or use an existing one.
2. Go in the 'Main data' tab and select the 'System Accounts' tab.
3. Modify 'Access Rights' to set it to `Active`.
4. Mark the 'Client Portal Access Allowed' checkbox.
5. Set the password for the client by clicking on the 'Send Welcove E-mail' or 'Send Password Reset E-mail' button. This will send an email to the client with steps to set the password.
6. You can also use 'Sign in as this Partner' to log in and validate the client's access to the XTRF Customer portal.
